- 👋 Hi, I’m @kartikmishraa
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, I enjoy coding in college, I am always trying to upskill myself and I would love to contribute to projects, because I want to put my
      learnings to test, and I want to be at par with other programmers around the world.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. I am in my second year of study and I am engrossed in learning various programming concepts (DSA, OOP, etc.) 

- 💞️ I’m open to contributing to open source projects, as long as I feel they are within my scope. I would also love learn new things and push my limits, I am
      constantly looking to improve my skills and learn from others.
